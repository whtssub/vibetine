# Vibetine

A valentine proposal site (*pun intended*).

## About

This is a **vibe-coded** pet project to test out [Kimi K2.5](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/)’s agentic capabilities. They’re insane: from zero to a built, deployed site on Vercel in **~15 minutes**.

Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build & deploy

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy the `dist` folder (e.g. to Vercel—see `vercel.json`).
